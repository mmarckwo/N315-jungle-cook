For this project, Michael and I were tasked to create a website for recipes created by The Jungle Cook, an online cooking site for amateur chefs. Utilizing CRUD application and responsive design, we were able to create a dynamic site that allows users to create an account. It also allows users to log in using local storage and log in credentials, allowing users to create and edit their own recipe documents within the site. The landing home page appears upon load and the navigation bar allows users to navigate through the site. Creating and Viewing recipes requires signing up for an account and then logging in to access all the site features.

The Jungle Cook also loads with four pre-made recipes. These are found in the browse tab in the navigation bar. By following it, users can see that there are four recipes available without any creation. Users can add ingredients from these recipes to their own in the Create Recipes feature to mix and math tastes and textures to their personal tastes. Although data deletes upon reload, but local storage allows for storing of created recipes once a user has created an account. Additionally, links within the footer work as well, aside from the recipe categories, which is still under construction.
